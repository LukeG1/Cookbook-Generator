  notes:
    - I always use mini tortillas for this, makes for a way more fun eating expierience, and green salsa or lime is a must

sections:
  - batter
  - topping

ingredients:
  - chorizo:
    name: chorizo
    quantity: 1/2
    unit: lbs
  - potato:
    name: potato
    quantity: 1
  - olive_oil:
    name: olive oil
  - vinegar:
    name: vinegar
  - sour_cream:
    name: sour cream
  - green_salsa:
    name: green salsa

steps:
  main:
    - Set a medium pot of water to boil
    - Chop the {#potato} into chunks, I tend to do 4 planks then cut those into cubes, with a small potato this shold result in a good sized chunk.
    - Put the chopped potato in the water and add a splah of {vinegar}, this is optional but will make the potatoes easier to handle later for chemistry reasons.
    - Put your {#chorizo} in a cold pan and set the heat to medium - medium high, doing this will allow more of the fat to render out.
    - Cook the {chorizo} and use a spatual to break it up into bite sized pieces, but not to the point that it is all small pieces.
    - When the {potato|potatoes} are just able to be pierced by a fork with some pressure, move the chorizo to a plate, drain the potatoes, and add them back to the pan with the chorizo fat.
    - Cook the potatoes, moving them around until all sides are dark and crispy, you will need to add more oil as you go but not much.
    - once the pototes are almost crispy enough to your liking add back in the chorizo and let it all cook togerher to warm back up.
    - Plate to your liking, I reccomend a layer of sour cream to hold everything together, then the mixture, then some green salsa.
