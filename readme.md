# Cookbook Builder

This project is designed to function mostly as a set of tools to design cookbooks using web tools I'm comfortable with into a pdf that can be printed, as well as offering a text backup of recipes I care about in a readable format

# How to use

## setup

tbd
brew install weasyprint

## other stuff

doesn't exist yet

# why html

I can write it quickly and it's super easy to template

# Submitting a template

not sure yet
include tailwind thing for consistency

# notes to self

hijack meta tags of html in templates for info about the template
like they should allow swaping out fonts, but come with sugested fonts, and credit etc
special features it doesn't support

a lot of this could happen clientside with read-pdf in the future, this version will exist more as a local tool

weasyprint approach won't work, now on to react-pdf or maybe selenium again
