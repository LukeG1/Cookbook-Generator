# Cookbook Builder

This project is designed to function mostly as a set of tools to design cookbooks using web tools I'm comfortable with into a pdf that can be printed, as well as offering a text backup of recipes I care about in a readable format

# How to use

doesn't exist yet

# why html

I can write it quickly and it's super easy to template

# Submitting a template

# notes to self

hijack meta tags of html in templates for info about the template
like they should allow swaping out fonts, but come with sugested fonts, and credit etc
